1. To get the data in the desired format enter the following at the command line:
    ./data.sh

	-Download a version of the Subtlex corpus with part-of-speech tags
	-Download a version of the Cmudict pronunciation dictionary
	-Get the frequency and dominant part-of-speech for content words from Subtlex
	-Remove punctuation, stress, and variant information from Cmudict
	-Create a list of words found in both Cmudict and Subtlex	
	-cmudict is a revised pronunciation dictionary containing only words that have frequency info in subtlex
	-subtlex is a list of words with the frequency of the most dominant part-of-speech
	
2. To get minimal pairs do the following from the command line:
	$ python
	
	>>> from min_pairs import *
	>>> subtlex = get_corpus('subtlex')
	>>> cmudict = get_dictionary('cmudict', subtlex.keys())
	# Get minimal pairs for the COT-CAUGHT distinction
	>>> get_minimal_pairs('AO', 'AA', cmudict, subtlex, post_exclude=['R']) 
	# Get minimal pairs for the PIN-PEN merger
	>>> get_minimal_pairs('IH', 'EH', cmudict, subtlex, post_include=['N', 'M', 'NG']) 

	-The output files will be stored in a file based on the names of the sounds (e.g. AO_AA.prs)
	-The file will contain a list of minimal pairs along with frequencies and dominant pos
